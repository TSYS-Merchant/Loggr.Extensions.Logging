Loggr.Extensions.Logging=======================[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/l3snx3wl42pluf8p/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mbishopim3/loggr-framework-logging/branch/master) [![NuGet Version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Loggr.Extensions.Logging.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Loggr.Extensions.Logging/) Log to [Loggr][0] from [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging][1].Installation------------Loggr.Extensions.Logging installs through NuGet:```PS> Install-Package Loggr.Extensions.Logging```Configure the Loggr provider through code:```c#var factory = new LoggerFactory();var logger = factory.CreateLogger( "MyLog" );factory.AddLoggr();```In the example we create a new `LoggerFactory` and add the Loggr provider using the `AddLoggr` extension method. It is important to still set up your application configuration settings that the Loggr library injects as a new configuration section, specifically the `logKey` and `apiKey`.Usage-----Log messages to Loggr, just as with every other provider:```c#logger.LogInformation( "This is information" );```License / Support=================Copyright 2012-2015 iMobile3, LLC.
